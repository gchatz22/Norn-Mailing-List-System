Partitions

Set operators:
	union 
		doesn't occur, occurs once, occurs many
		of 1x1, >1x1, 1x>1

	difference 
		doesn't occur, occurs once, occurs many
		of 1x1, >1x1, 1x>1
		result size is 0, 1, >1

	intersection 
		doesn't occur, occurs once, occurs many
		of 1x1, >1x1, 1x>1
		results size is 0, 1, >1


List definitions:
	size is 1, >1
	test for a=(b=c) examples


Sequence:
	no semicolons, 1 semicolon, >1 semicolons
	result is length 0, 1, >1
	invalid sequence, unknown list name. e.g. (a=x@mit.edu)*b


Parallel:
	0 pipes, 1 pipe, >1 pipes
	correct evaluation, incorrect evaluation (unknown list name)


Whitespace:
	whitespace occurrence 0, 1, >1 before and after ","
